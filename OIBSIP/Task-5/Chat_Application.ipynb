            "    * **Data Science and Machine Learning:** Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn are widely used for data analysis and machine learning.\n",
            "    * **Scripting and Automation:** Python is excellent for automating repetitive tasks.\n",
            "    * **Game Development:** Libraries like Pygame are used for creating games.\n",
