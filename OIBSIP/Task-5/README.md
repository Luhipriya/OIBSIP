# Task 5: Simple Chatbot Interaction

## üí° Description
This project demonstrates a basic conversational chatbot that can respond to user greetings, simple questions about programming (like Python), and provide polite replies. The bot handles typical chat flow, including greetings, farewells, and common queries.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use
Run the chatbot script and interact by typing messages. The bot will respond based on predefined answers.

Example commands:
- "hello"
- "how are you?"
- "what is python"
- "bye"
- "exit" to end the chat

## üß™ Example Conversation

You: hello
Bot: Hello there! How can I help you today?
You: how are you?
Bot: Bot: I'm doing well, thank you for asking!  How are you today?
You: I too doing well
Bot: That's great to hear! Is there anything I can help you with today?
You: what is time now?
Bot: I cannot give you the current time.  I am a language model and do not have access to real-time information, including the current time and date.  You can check a clock or your device's time display for that information.
You: kk
Bot: Okay. Is there anything else I can help you with?
You: what is python
Bot: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.  It's known for its clear syntax and relatively easy learning curve, making it popular for both beginners and experienced programmers.

Here are some key features of Python:

* **Interpreted Language:** Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution. This makes development and debugging easier.

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Python supports OOP principles, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects.

* **Dynamically Typed:** You don't need to explicitly declare the data type of variables; Python infers it at runtime.

* **Large Standard Library:** Python comes with a vast collection of built-in modules and libraries that provide ready-to-use functionalities for various tasks, including web development, data science, machine learning, and more.

You: kk thanks!,Bye
Bot: You're welcome! Have a great day!
You: exit
üëã Goodbye!
